# potring project
Making an LED ring around a potentiometer for guitar pedals such that the settings can be stored without the need for digital encoders!

This repository gives access to the PCB design of:
- The potring PCB itself, which can be placed on an STEREO analog potentiometer
- The MCU PCB, which allows to interconnect multiple potring PCBs in a modular fashion up to 4 pots. This PCB contains an STM32 which controlls the potrings.

**PLUS, The firmware for an implementation example for a ProCo Rat guitar pedal:**

The documentation is very limited at the moment. If I find more time, I will definitely update :). But feel free to contact me on Reddit:
